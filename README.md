# John Conway's Game of Life - Terminal

The code in this repository is the terminal version implemented in *Python* for the _Game of Life_ automaton.

## Dependencies

The code has no dependencies outside of the built-in Python libraries. The only requirement is having at least Python *3.7.1+* for some of the language features to work.

## Run locally

To run, assuming that the *Dependencies* part is satisfied, just run, in the root of this repository's directory:

```
python main.py
```

This will create a 30 x 30 (default size) grid of randomly generated cells in your terminal screen, so make sure your terminal window is large enough for it to fit completely into. The simulation will also start automatically. Enjoy!

## Browser version

The browser version for this same automaton I implemented using ReactJS can be found [here](http://github.com/jgabriel1/conways-game-of-life).
